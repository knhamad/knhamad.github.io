Hello and welcome! My Name is Khaled Hamad. I have received my Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical Engineering at the American University of Kuwait (AUK). After getting my B.E., I went to the University of Florida (UF) and earned my Master of Science with thesis in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE). My thesis topic was: [Smart Grid Real-Time Monitoring Cyber Physical System Security Enhancement:
IIR-Gamma Filter-Based Solution](https://ufdc.ufl.edu/UFE0058071/00001/downloads). During my Master degree I have grown a big interest in Machine Learning. So, I am currently pursuing [Ph.D. in Machine Learning](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/machine-learning/2021/08/welcome-new-phd-student-khaled-hamad/) at UF in the ECE Department working with [Prof. Alina Zare](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/machine-learning/people/faculty/) in the [Machine Learning and Sensing Lab](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/machine-learning/) for research and algorithm developing for a variety of applications.
