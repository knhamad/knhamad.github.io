## Research Interests
 Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Image Processing
## Summary
I conduct research in the Machine Learning and Sensing Lab on detecting Aflatoxin on peanuts using Hyperspectral data. I developed image segmentation models using clustering and deep learning algorithms. I plan to develop a model that will be able to detect and identify the level of aflatoxin on peanuts. Aflatoxin is the number 1 cause of liver cancer globally, which is why it is an urgent problem that needs a solution. The first step toward this goal is to collect Hyperspectral Images of peanuts and segment the images so that we have the peanut pixels separated from the bachground pixels. After that, develop target detectors that are optimized for aflatoxin spectra. Then, identifying the level of aflatoxin on each of those pixels. My research can be applied to numerous difficult real-world applications affecting human life; such as self-driving cars, autonomous robotics, augmented reality, and automated medical diagnosis.
