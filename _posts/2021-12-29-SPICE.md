## Problem Statement: Hyperspectral Data Collection
Hyperspectral cameras (HSCs) provide a huge contribution to remote sensing data. They have been used in a variety of application such as food safety, biomedical, and forensic applications. HSCs are operated on specific regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Some are focused on the VNIR and others on SWIR. Below is an example of how Hysperspectral Image (HSI) looks like:
![HSI image](/images/SPICE Blog/HSI example.JPG)

<br/>The problem with HSCs is that there are many aspects that would affect the gathered data, like atmospheric effects, light scattering to different molecules before reflected back to the HSC, and many other. In addition to this problem, data gathered with drone HSC, which have wider field of view where each pixel would be a 1x1 meter or even higher in reality. Pixels with this size could have multiple objects in them. For example, disregarding atmospheric effects, a pixel could have sand, water, and bricks in it and when the HSC captures the reflectance, the spectrum of that pixel will be a mix of those 3 materials. Therefore, it would be hard to tell if the spectra that is being observed is a pure pixel of the object being analyzed. That is where the Linear Mixing Model (LMM) comes in. The LMM assumes that each pixel is a mix of spectra that consists of endmembers and a proportion value for each endmember. Below is the LMM equation.<br/>
![LMM](/images/SPICE Blog/LMM.JPG)<br/>




**X**<sub>*i*</sub> is the observed pixel, *p*<sub>*ik*</sub> is the proportion of endmember *k* in pixel *i*, **E**<sub>*k*</sub> is the k<sup>th</sup> endmember, and $\varepsilon<sub>*i*</sub>$ is an error term. The LMM assumes that each of the 3 materials, from the previous example, has its own endmember and a proportion value in every pixel and combing them produces the seen spectrum. The figure below illustrates this process for a single pixel captured by HSC.
![Linear mixing model](/images/SPICE Blog/Linear mixing example.JPG)<br/>

where **y** represents the measured spectrum for that pixel (it is the **X**<sub>*i*</sub> in the LMM equation). The **m** (it is the **E**<sub>*k*</sub> in the LMM equation) represents the endmembers and in this case, there are 3 endmembers. Etimating the number of endmembers present in an HSI data is known as Hyperspectral Unmixing. Endmembers are an estimated representative spectra of the materials in HSI. From the pixel example mentioned previously, each of the sand, water, bricks will have their own endmember. <br/>

There are many endmember extraction algorithms in the state-of-the-art with a variety of approaches like geometrical, statistical, and sparse regression ([Bioucas-Dias, et. al., 2012](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6200362)). This post is about Sparsity Promoting Iterated Constrained Endmember Extraction algorithm also known as SPICE, which is a geometrical approach of finding the endmembers


## Method: SPICE
To put it in the most simple manner, take the figure below as an example for how the SPICE approach works. This is a one-dimensional example. The data that is in the center of the endmember at point (2,0) represents 50% proportion for each endmember. The data at (1.5,0) represents 75% proportion for endmember 1 because it is closer to that endmember and 25% for endmember 2.<br/>
![1D endmember example](/images/SPICE Blog/1D endmember example.JPG)<br/>
The data needs to be inside the canvas that the endmembers create, which is why the SPICE algorithm includes a constraint that the  value of each proportion should be positive and the sum of the proportions for each data should equal to 1. <br/>
![proportion constaint equation](/images/SPICE Blog/proportion constaint equation.JPG)<br/>
where *p* is the proportion and *M* is the number of endmembers. Here is another example with 2D data. As mentioned before, the data needs to be inside the region that the endmembers create when connecting them together. In the example below if the endmembers are connected, it will create a simplex (triangle) shape.<br/>
![2D endmember example](/images/SPICE Blog/2D endmember example.JPG)<br/>
![2D endmember example (simplex)](/images/SPICE Blog/2D endmember example (simplex).JPG)<br/>
The same concept applies, the closer the data to an endmember, the higher the proportion of that data will be to that endmember and the rest of the proportions will be divided to the other endmembers. In cases where the data is placed outside of the simplex, this will result in an error. A solution to this error could be adding an extra endmember to expand the simplex region to include that data. This brings in the concept of how SPICE does not actually have a unique solution. Meaning, from the triangle example above, there are infinite number of ways to include this whole data using 3 endmembers. It can also be done using more than 3 endmembers. So there are 2 problems that needs to be addressed:
1. Minimize the error between the data and estimated endmembers to decrease the number of endmembers.
2. Minimize the distance between the endmembers to have the smallest region as possible coverd by the endmembers or find a tight fit around the data.


### How is the error between the data and estimated endmembers minimized?
The error between the data and estimated endmembers is minimized using the residual sum of squared formula. <br/>
![RSS equation](/images/SPICE Blog/RSS equation.JPG)<br/>
where **X**<sub>*i*</sub> is the data, *p* is the proportion, and **E**<sub>*k*</sub> is the endmember. The equation is minimized subjected to the contraint mentioned previously.
### How is the distance between the estimated endmembers minimized?
The distance between the estimated endmembers is minimized using the sum of squared distance formula. <br/>
![SSD equation](/images/SPICE Blog/SSD equation.JPG)<br/>
The equation is minimized subjected to the contraint mentioned previously.
### The objective function

## Implementation of SPICE
SPICE is implemented using the following steps:
1. Random number of endmembers are initialized (could also be initialized to a random set of data)
2. The proportions are calculated from the endmembers by minimizing the Quadratic Programming Problem (QPP).
3. New members are found based on the proportions from step 2 using the below equation.<br/>

4. steps 2 and 3 are iteratively repeated until the objective function RSS<sub>reg</sub> is smaller than a threshold value.
