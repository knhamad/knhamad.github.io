## Problem Statement: Hyperspectral Data Collection
Hyperspectral cameras (HSCs) provide a huge contribution to remote sensing data. They have been used in a variety of application such as food safety, biomedical, and forensic applications. HSCs are operated on specific regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Some are focused on the VNIR and others on SWIR. Below is an example of how Hysperspectral Image (HSI) looks like:

The problem with HSCs is that there are many aspects that would affect the gathered data, like atmospheric effects, light scattering to different molecules before reflected back to the HSC, and many other. In addition to this problem, data gathered with drone HSC, which have wider field of view where each pixel would be a 1x1 meter or even higher in reality. Pixels with this size could have multiple objects in them. For example, disregarding atmospheric effects, a pixel could have sand, water, and bricks in it and when the HSC captures it, this pixel will be a mix of those 3 materials.
